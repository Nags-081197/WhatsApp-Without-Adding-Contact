Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to text someone on WhatsApp and did not want to go through the whole process of Adding their contact and then texting them on WhatsApp. Default WhatsApp does not allow you to do that.

Here's a WebApp that I have built, which enables you to just enter the phone number that you wanna send the WhatsApp text to and would be redirected to their chat on WhatsApp.

This Application is platform or operating system independent and it even works with your Whatsapp Web.
